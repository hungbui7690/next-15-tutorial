/*
  Using Suspense & Streamed Responses For Granular Loading State Management
  - when in loading state -> the whole page is hidden
  - but we just want to hide the dynamic data, not the static ones
  
  1. remove loading.js 
  2. copy code from loading.css.module to meals/page.module.css
  3. /meals/page.js
    -> apply suspense component with fallback
